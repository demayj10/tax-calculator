# Tax Calculator (Income)

Web Application that takes user information including,
 - Gross Annual Income
   - Salary or
   - Hourly
 -  Tax filing marital status
 -  State
 
These values are used to generate a tax breakdown that includes all of the income tax totals that the user would have to pay across both Federal and, if applicable State Income tax rates. Medicare and Social Security tax are also calculated for the Federal tax breakdown part of the report. Also included in the report is the highest tax rate the user would be paying based on their income bracket for any category.

- The point of this web app is to generate accurate reports of what a user can expect to pay in taxes in a year, and where those taxes are going to, so they can make calculated decisions with the remaining amount.

- *This project is mostly a small project to improve my own ability with Typescript and React along with putting in place best practices around testing and CI/CD.*
